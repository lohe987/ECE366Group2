# ECE366Group2
This is an ISA design for project 2 of ECE366 at UIC, Fall 2018, taught by Dr. Wenjing Rao
The purpose of ISA is to achieve two different purposes:
1. Compute the results of (6^P)%Q where P and Q are 16-bit unsigned integers that are stored in memory and 
  will be input in before the actual program runs. 
2. Given a 16-bit binary string, compare it to each member of a 16-bit binary strings array, and
  determine what the best match score is (i.e. how many bits they have that are the same, position matters).
  In addition, if there are duplicates of the best match score, then return how many of them there were. 
  
Our ISA will be called, "Give us full points for our pointers" ISA 
Group members are:
